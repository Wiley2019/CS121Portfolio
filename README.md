<h2 align= "center"> Welcome :pinched_fingers: to my amazing Portfolio </h2>
<h3 align= "center"> My name is Christopher Wiley; I am a graduating senior from Ball State University in May '25, Majoring in Applied CyberSecurity</h3>
<h4 align= "left"> In my years of education and schooling, I had to take some of the work and upload it here for many to see. With everything I have experienced in my journey through school, I have made my life a lot easier while coding and writing programs; having an example of what I want to look back at while working on new items allows for better work.  </h4>
